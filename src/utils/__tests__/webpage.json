January 30, 2019\n\n  Facebook\n\n  Twitter\n\n  7.13pm EST 19:13\n\n  Trump administration claims of progress in talks with the Taliban have sparked fears that his impatience with the war in Afghanistan will lead him to withdraw troops too soon, the Associated Press is reporting, leaving the country at risk of returning to the same volatile condition that prompted the invasion in the first place.\n\n\n\n  Discussions between a U.S. envoy and the Taliban are advancing weeks after the administration said it wanted to begin drawing down troops in Afghanistan. That has prompted some critics to note that President Donald Trump is telegraphing a withdrawal the same thing he accused President Barack Obama of doing by saying he wanted to end the American combat mission in 2014.\n\n  \u201cIt\u2019s an effort to put lipstick on what will be a U.S. withdrawal,\u201d said Ryan Crocker, a former U.S. ambassador to Kabul under Obama.\n\n  A negotiated settlement to America\u2019s longest war poses a dilemma for Trump. He has often declared he wants to end lengthy overseas military entanglements, something he made clear in December by declaring the Islamic State group defeated in Syria and announcing he was pulling 2,000 American troops from that country over the objections of his top foreign policy advisers.\n\n  The stakes are higher in Afghanistan, a conflict that has cost 2,400 American lives and hundreds of billions in taxpayer dollars. The U.S. invaded the country to oust the Taliban and al-Qaida in October 2001 in response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, and the CIA director warned as recently as Tuesday that Afghanistan could once again become a terrorist haven.\n\n  Facebook\n\n  Twitter\n\n  6.48pm EST 18:48\n\n  An undocumented immigrant who had spoken out about the abusive conditions she endured while working for the Trump Organization has been invited to the president\u2019s State of the Union address, the Associated Press is reporting.\n\n\n\n  A spokeswoman for New Jersey Democratic congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman confirmed Wednesday that her guest will be Victorina Morales, who was born in Guatemala.\n\n  Morales has spoken out about the Trump Organization\u2019s hiring practices. The Trump Organization said Wednesday that it will use the E-Verify electronic system at all its properties to check employees\u2019 documentation.\n\n  Trump has repeatedly cast millions of immigrants in the country illegally as taking jobs from American citizens. He turned over day-to-day management of his business to sons Eric and Donald Jr. when he took office.\n\n  Facebook\n\n  Twitter\n\n  6.32pm EST 18:32\n\n  The US Department of Energy has already shipped weapons-grade plutonium from South Carolina to a nuclear security site in Nevada, despite the state\u2019s protests, the Associated Press is reporting.\n\n\n\n  The Justice Department notified a federal judge in Reno that the government trucked in half of the radioactive material that it intends to store at the site 70 miles (113 kilometers) north of Las Vegas. Nevada had filed a request for an injunction to block the move in November.\n\n  Department lawyers said in a nine-page filing that the previously classified information about the shipment from South Carolina can be disclosed now because enough time has passed to protect national security. They didn\u2019t specify when the one-half metric ton of plutonium was transferred.\n\n  Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak said he\u2019s \u201cbeyond outraged by this completely unacceptable deception.\u201d He said he\u2019s working with Nevada\u2019s congressional delegation to fight back against the U.S. government\u2019s \u201creckless disregard\u201d for the safety of Nevadans.\n\n  Facebook\n\n  Twitter\n\n  6.06pm EST 18:06\n\n  New charges and arrests are possible in the prosecution of a US Treasury Department employee accused of giving a BuzzFeed journalist confidential banking reports related to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia probe, the Associated Press is reporting.\n\n\n\n\n  Treasury worker Natalie Edwards is awaiting trial on charges that she gave a BuzzFeed journalist reports about wire transfers made by Paul Manafort and other suspects in Mueller\u2019s investigation.\n\n  Assistant U.S. Attorney Kimberly Ravener told a New York judge during a hearing Wednesday that prosecutors will know within two to three months whether additional charges will be filed.\n\n  She provided no other details as to who else might be under scrutiny.\n\n  Edwards\u2019 lawyer, Jacob Kaplan, says his client is being prosecuted for \u201cdoing the right thing.\u201d\n\n  Facebook\n\n  Twitter\n\n  6.03pm EST 18:03\n\n  Three Democratic congressmen are urging the Pentagon to revise a report on climate change, saying it omitted required items and \u201cfailed to meet basic requirements,\u201d Reuters is reporting.   Jim Langevin  (@JimLangevin)\n\n  .@DeptofDefense\u2019s #climatechange report does not meet the requirements of my amendment and does not reflect the magnitude of the climate-related threats facing our military. @RepAdamSmith, @RepGaramendi & I are calling for a revised report. #ClimateSecurityIsNationalSecurity pic.twitter.com/oacTH37N05  January 30, 2019\n\n\n\n  The Pentagon\u2019s report, released on Jan. 10, said climate change was a national security issue and listed 79 domestic military installations at risk from floods, drought, encroaching deserts, wildfires and, in Alaska, thawing permafrost.\n\n  But the report, required by a defense policy law signed by President Donald Trump in 2017, did not include the top 10 list, and details of specific mitigation measures to make bases more resilient to climate change, including the costs. It also failed to list any Marine Corps bases or installations overseas.\n\n  U.S. Representative Adam Smith, the chairman of the House committee, said the Trump administration\u2019s report was inadequate. \u201cIt demonstrates a continued unwillingness to seriously recognize and address the threat that climate change poses to our national security and military readiness,\u201d Smith said in a release.\n\n  Trump has repeatedly cast doubt on the science of climate change, arguing that the causes and impacts are not yet settled. As a temporary blast of frigid cold hit the Midwest this week he said on Twitter \u201cWhat the Hell is going on with Global Wa(r)ming. Please come back fast, we need you!\u201d\n\n  The letter, addressed to Acting Defense Department Secretary Patrick Shanahan and a copy of which was seen by Reuters, called the report \u201cdeeply disappointing.\u201d It requested a revised report by April 1.\n\n  The report said major installations including Florida\u2019s MacDill Air Force Base, Virginia\u2019s Norfolk Naval Station, and California\u2019s Coronado Naval Base, face risks from flooding currently and in the future. In all, 53 installations already face flooding, it said.\n\n  Updated at 8.06pm EST\n\n  Facebook\n\n  Twitter\n\n  5.17pm EST 17:17\n\n  A federal judge is refusing to unseal criminal charges against Wikileaks founder Julian Assange that were mistakenly revealed in another case, the Associated Press is reporting.\n\n\n\n  In a ruling issued Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema said that free-press advocates seeking to unseal the charges have no proof Assange has actually been charged.\n\n  The Reporters Committee for the Freedom of the Press sought to unseal the charges after a federal prosecutor inadvertently typed a reference to \u201cthe fact that Assange has been charged\u201d in an unrelated case.\n\n  The government has acknowledged it made an error but has not publicly confirmed that charges against Assange have been filed.\n\n  After the mistake was made, news outlets including The Associated Press reported Assange is indeed facing unspecified charges under seal. But those reports relied on anonymous sources.\n\n  Facebook\n\n  Twitter\n\n  5.13pm EST 17:13   Russians leaked Mueller investigation evidence online, prosecutors say\n\n  The Guardian\u2019s Jon Swaine is reporting that \u201cmore than 1,000 files shared confidentially appeared to have been uploaded to a filesharing site.\u201d\n\n\n\n  Evidence gathered by Robert Mueller, the special counsel, was obtained by Russians and leaked online in an attempt to discredit his inquiry into Moscow\u2019s interference in US politics, prosecutors said on Wednesday.\n\n  A court filing by Mueller\u2019s office said more than 1,000 files that it shared confidentially with attorneys for indicted Russian hackers later appeared to have been uploaded to a filesharing site and promoted by a Twitter account.\n\n  \u201cWe\u2019ve got access to the Special Counsel Mueller\u2019s probe database as we hacked Russian server with info from the Russian troll case,\u201d a tweet from the account said. \u201cYou can view all the files Mueller had about the IRA and Russian collusion.

But the three-week funding bill, which Congress cleared last week ending the longest shutdown in government history, expires on Feb. 15.\n\n  \u201cAs you know, the conference committee has begun negotiations to keep the federal government funded beyond February 15,\u201d House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) wrote in a letter to colleagues Wednesday. \u201cGiven the critical importance of these efforts, we have decided to postpone our issues conference until a later date.\u201d\n\n  Facebook\n\n  Twitter        1 of 3\n\n  Newest\n\n  Newer\n\n  Older   Oldest\n\n  Topics\n\n  - US politics\n  - US politics live\n\n  - Venezuela\n  - Democrats\n  - Republicans\n  - Americas\n  - US foreign policy\n  - Donald Trump\n\n  - Share on Facebook\n  - Share on Twitter\n  - Share via Email\n  - Share on LinkedIn\n  - Share on Pinterest\n  - Share on WhatsApp\n  - Share on Messenger\n\n  - Reuse this content                            Most popular\n\n  - US\n  - World\n  - Environment\n  - Soccer\n  - US Politics\n  - Business\n  - Tech\n  - Science\n\n  - About us\n  - Contact us\n  - Complaints & corrections\n  - SecureDrop\n  - Work for us\n  - Privacy policy\n  - Cookie policy\n  - Terms & conditions\n  - Help\n\n  - All topics\n  - All writers\n  - Digital newspaper archive\n  - Facebook\n  - Twitter\n\n  - Advertise with us\n  - Guardian Labs\n  - Search jobs\n  - Dating\n  - Discount Codes     Support The\u00a0Guardian   Available for everyone, funded by readers    Contribute\n\n  Subscribe\n\n   Back to top\n\n  \u00a9 2019 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
